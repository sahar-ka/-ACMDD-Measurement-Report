# ACMDD – Measurement Report

This repository contains the report for the **Advanced Computational Methods in Drug Discovery (ACMDD)** course, group project.  
Our project focused on **designing new ligands for the Histamine H1 receptor (HRH1, UniProt Accession P35367)**.  

## Contents
- `FinalReport.ipynb` → Full measurement report including:
  - Bioinformatics analysis of HRH1  
  - Machine Learning  
  - Docking  

- Additional screenshots for intermediate results.  

## How to view the report
The notebook is large, so GitHub sometimes does not render it directly. Please use nbviewer to access it:
